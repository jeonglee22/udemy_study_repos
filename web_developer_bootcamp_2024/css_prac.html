    <h1>Cocacola</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        <span class="a">Coca-Cola</span>, or Coke, is a carbonated soft drink with a cola flavor manufactured by the Coca-Cola Company. 
        In 2013, Coke products were sold in over 200 countries worldwide, with consumers drinking more than 1.8 
        billion company beverage servings each day.[1] <span class="a">Coca-Cola</span> ranked No. 87 in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of 
        the largest United States corporations by total revenue.[2] Based on Interbrand's "best global brand" 
        study of 2020, <span class="a">Coca-Cola</span> was the world's sixth most valuable brand.[3]
    </p>

    <p>
        Originally marketed as a temperance drink and intended as a patent medicine, <span class="b">Coca-Cola</span> was invented in 
        the late 19th century by John Stith Pemberton in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1888, Pemberton sold the ownership 
        rights to Asa Griggs Candler, a businessman, whose marketing tactics led <span class="b">Coca-Cola</span> to its dominance of 
        the global soft-drink market throughout the 20th and 21st century.[4] The name refers to two of its 
        original ingredients: coca leaves and kola nuts (a source of caffeine).[5] The current formula of 
        <span class="b">Coca-Cola</span> remains a trade secret; however, a variety of reported recipes and experimental recreations 
        have been published. The secrecy around the formula has been used by <span class="b">Coca-Cola</span> in its marketing as only 
        a handful of anonymous employees know the formula.[6] The drink has inspired imitators and created a whole 
        classification of soft drink: colas.

        The Coca-Cola Company produces concentrate, which is then sold to licensed Coca-Cola bottlers throughout 
        the world. The bottlers, who hold exclusive territory contracts with the company, produce the finished 
        product in cans and bottles from the concentrate, in combination with filtered water and sweeteners. A 
        typical 12-US-fluid-ounce (350 ml) can contains 38 grams (1.3 oz) of sugar (usually in the form of high-fructose 
        corn syrup in North America). The bottlers then sell, distribute, and merchandise Coca-Cola to retail stores, 
        restaurants, and vending machines throughout the world. The Coca-Cola Company also sells concentrate for soda 
        fountains of major restaurants and foodservice distributors.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>19th century historical origins</h3>
    <p>
        Confederate Colonel John Pemberton, wounded in the American Civil War and addicted to morphine, also had 
        a medical degree and began a quest to find a substitute for the problematic drug.[8] In 1885 at Pemberton's 
        Eagle Drug and Chemical House, his drugstore in Columbus, Georgia, he registered Pemberton's French Wine Coca 
        nerve tonic.[9][10][11][12] Pemberton's tonic may have been inspired by the formidable success of Vin Mariani, 
        a French-Corsican coca wine,[13] but his recipe additionally included the African kola nut, the beverage's 
        source of caffeine.[14] A Spanish drink called "Kola Coca" was presented at a contest in Philadelphia in 1885, 
        a year before the official birth of Coca-Cola. The rights for this Spanish drink were bought by Coca-Cola in 1953.[15]

    <h3>Company</h3>
    <p>
        After Candler had gained a better foothold on Coca-Cola in April 1888, he nevertheless was forced to sell 
        the beverage he produced with the recipe he had under the names "Yum Yum" and "Koke". This was while Charley 
        Pemberton was selling the elixir, although a cruder mixture, under the name "Coca-Cola", all with his father's 
        blessing. After both names failed to catch on for Candler, by the middle of 1888, the Atlanta pharmacist was 
        quite anxious to establish a firmer legal claim to Coca-Cola, and hoped he could force his two competitors, 
        Walker and Dozier, completely out of the business, as well.[25]
