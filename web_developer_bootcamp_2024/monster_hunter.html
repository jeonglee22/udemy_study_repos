    <h1>Monster Hunter</h1>

    <p><b>Monster Hunter</b> (モンスターハンター, Monsutā Hantā)
        is a Japanese media franchise centered on a series of
        fantasy-themed action role-playing video games that
        started with the game Monster Hunter for the
        PlayStation 2, released in 2004. Titles have been
        released across a variety of platforms, including
        personal computers, home consoles, portable consoles,
        and mobile devices. The series is developed and
        published by Capcom.
    </p>

    <p>The games are primarily action role-playing games.
        The player takes the role of a Hunter, slaying or
        trapping large monsters across various landscapes
        as part of quests given to them by locals, with
        some quests involving the gathering of a certain
        item or items, which may put the Hunter at risk of
        facing various monsters. As part of its core
        gameplay loop, players use loot gained from
        slaying monsters, gathering resources, and quest
        rewards to craft improved weapons, armor, and
        other items that allow them to face more powerful
        monsters. All main series titles feature multiplayer
        (usually up to four players cooperatively), but can
        also be played single player.

        Gameplay
    </h2>

    <p>
        The core feature of Monster Hunter is its compulsion
        loop.[4] Unlike traditional computer role-playing
        games, a player's Hunter does not grow and has no
        intrinsic statistics or attributes whatsoever.
        Rather, the Hunter's abilities are instead defined
        by the specific weapons and armor selected. The
        player can equip weapons, armor, and items most
        beneficial towards completing a given mission,
        and if successful, the Hunter is awarded in both
        in-game money ("zenny") and loot representing parts
        from the monster.
